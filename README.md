🧠 Key Learnings
Use 12+ characters
Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
Avoid dictionary words and patterns
Prefer unique passwords for each account
Consider using a password manager

🚨 Common Password Attacks
Brute Force – Tries all possible combinations
Dictionary Attack – Uses lists of common words
Credential Stuffing – Reuses leaked credentials
Phishing – Tricks users into revealing passwords

🔒 Why Complexity Matters
Stronger passwords increase resistance to:
Automated guessing
Breached credential reuse
Social engineering attacks
More randomness = More time and computing power required to crack.
