Passwords with Varying Complexity


| Password                    | Complexity Level | Description                                         |
|-----------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
|  password123                | Low              | Common, no symbols, predictable                     |
|  PaSs1234                   | Medium           | Mix of cases and digits                             |
|  P@ssw0rd!                  | Medium-High      | Uses symbol and number substitutions                |
|  S7#fT8!rB@k9Z              | High             | Random characters, upper/lowercase, digits, symbols |
|  correcthorsebatterystaple  | High             | Long passphrase, dictionary words                   |
|  G9!xRz4#LpV2               | Very High        | Random, 12+ characters, complex mix                 |






*_Best Practices:

Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

Increase length — more than 12 characters significantly improves strength.

Avoid dictionary words unless in a long passphrase form.

Do not reuse passwords across multiple accounts.

Use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.

Substitute unpredictably — don’t rely on common substitutions like @ for a.


*_Tips:

Randomly generated passwords are strongest.

Long passphrases are secure if not based on popular quotes or patterns.

Adding complexity matters more when length is short.

Avoid predictable patterns (e.g., 123, qwerty, password).




Comman password attacks:

| Attack Type             | Description                                                             |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     Brute Force         | Tries all possible combinations until it finds the correct one.         |
|     Dictionary          | Uses a list of common words and phrases to guess passwords.             |
|   Credential Stuffing   | Tries previously breached username-password pairs on other sites.       |
|   Phishing              | Tricks users into giving up passwords via fake login pages or messages. |






Summary:
How Password Complexity Affects Security


Password complexity greatly increases security by:

Slowing down brute-force attacks — more combinations to test.

Reducing effectiveness of dictionary attacks — non-words or altered words confuse basic lists.

Improving entropy — each added type (symbol, digit, length) increases randomness.

Preventing reuse vulnerability — strong, unique passwords stop credential stuffing.
